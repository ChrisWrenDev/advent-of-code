# Advent of Code

Welcome to my **Advent of Code** solutions repository!

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge event that runs every December, offering a new programming puzzle each day leading up to Christmas. The puzzles are designed to be fun, challenging, and a great way to sharpen your coding skills. Participants from all around the world compete to solve these puzzles as quickly as possible.

This repository is a collection of my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. Each folder contains my approach and code for the corresponding day's challenge.
